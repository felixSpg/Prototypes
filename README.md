# Prototypes
SmartHome prototype I have created as a dynamic Prototype.

IN ORDER TO RUN PROTOTYPE:
1. Install Processing
2. Create new map
3. Download all files and save in the new map created in step 2.
4. Create new map within this map, name it to "data"
5. Move all files who are not .pde files to "data"-map.
6. Open all .pde-files togheter
7. Enjoy

When program is running, move character around and use keys 1,2,3,4 in order to switch character and watch how the lights in the house is changing depending on which character is being used

Press mousekey in order for the character(s) to interact with the lights in the house and see how the lights is fading into red as warning for loud volume.
